# Raise Our Bar

> Commonwealth of PA Judge Retention Data Analysis

In Pennsylvania, we elect our judges.
Judge elections are low information and little information is available
for voters to make choices.
Criminal court judges have 10-year terms in Philadelphia County.
Therefore, a decision to retain an elected judge has a long-term impact
on our criminal justice system.
So what can one do as a concerned citizen to become better informed?
Thankfully, court docket data is public data.
We have assembled court docket data that can help shed light
on how judges are performing their jobs.
This data has been de-identified to allow participants to explore these issues.

Create resources or tools that can enable Philadelphia voters
to make more informed choices about what judges to vote to retain on our courts.

submitted via the shared google doc (see link under Resources).
